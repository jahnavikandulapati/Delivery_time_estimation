# Delivery_time_estimation
Overview
In this exercise, you will use your machine learning experience to solve a straightforward but challenging prediction​ ​problem.​ ​The​ ​exercise​​contains two​​ parts​

Building​ ​a​ ​machine​ ​learning​ model​ ​ ​for​ ​a​ ​prediction ​ task​

In this, we would love to have you exhibit your modeling skills. You will be evaluated on the following - performance on the test set, feature engineering choices including features used and encoding of features, data processing, choice of models used, description of model performance and insights and observations from the​ ​model.

Problem ​Description
When​ a​ ​consumer​ ​places​ ​an​ ​order​ ​on​ DoorDash,​​ we​ ​ show​ ​ the​ ​ ​expected ​​time of​​ ​delivery.​ ​It​ ​is​ ​very ​important​ ​for​ DoorDash to get this right, as it has a big impact on consumer experience. In this exercise, you will build a model to predict the estimated time taken for a delivery and write an application that can make these predictions.

Concretely, for a given delivery you must predict the ​total delivery duration seconds , i.e., the time taken from

Start:​ ​the​ ​time​ ​consumer​ ​submits​ ​the​ ​order ​ (​created_at) ​ to​
End:​ ​when​ ​the​ ​order​ ​will​ ​be​ ​delivered​ to​ ​ ​the​ consumer​​​(actual_delivery_time).
To​ ​help​ ​with​ ​this,​ ​we​ ​have​ ​provided

historical_data.csv:​ ​table​ ​of​ ​historical​ ​deliveries
Requirements
Build a model to predict the total delivery duration seconds (as defined above). Feel free to generate additional​ ​features​ ​from​ ​the ​ given​ ​ data​ ​ to​ ​ improve​ ​ model​ ​performance.​
Explain a) model(s) used, b) how you evaluated your model performance on the historical data, c) any data processing you performed on the data, d) feature engineering choices you made and e) other information​ ​you​ ​would​ ​like​ ​us​ ​to​ ​know​ ​about​ ​your​​modeling​ ​approach.
Based ​ on​ ​ the​ ​ ​findings ​​from​ ​the​ ​model,​ list​​ ​recommendations​ to​​​reduce​ ​delivery​ ​time
